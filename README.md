# ComfyUI-ModelUnloader
A simple custom node that unloads all models. Useful for developers or users who want to free some memory.
You can find it in LJRE/utils category. Or, double-click and look for Unload (or something).
Always check your VRAM manually. This first version may not unload everything.

If you've used the node once already, you have to delete it and put it back in the workflow for it to work again!
